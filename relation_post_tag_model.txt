     //We will create relationship between post model and tag model and we have to create another migration file  and migration file name will be post_tag
     //Migration file name will be alphabetic way post_tag
     //We will find tags from post model
     //Now we have to think from post model, Multiple tags can have in one post


    //same way we will find posts from tag model

            $table->id();
            $table->unsignedInteger('post_id');    //unsignedInteger means value will be never minus and convention(alphabetic order -> post_id, tag_id) follow will be better
